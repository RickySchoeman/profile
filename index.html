           <h2>A Mobile App for the Conscious Consumer</h2>
            <p>My idea behind Amandla was that while most people would like to be better social and environmental consumers, there are so many different metrics to measure this by - which can be overwhelming. Amandla makes this easier, by allowing a user to filter the desired social and environmental causes they would like to support, and directs them to businesses that are aligned with these beliefs</p>
            <p>Amandla was built over 2 weeks, by my team and I, using Ruby on Rails, HTML + CSS, and JavaScript. Built for mobile</p>

            metal-infused showers (accentuated my already dire hair-loss situation), navigating the traffic madness and absolutely
            no large body of swimmable water to speak of, were causing some serious balding and bellying."</h6>

            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p> After studying Ecomomics and Environmental Science in South Africa, I spent the last decade doing freelance work on leisure
            yachts, sound-proofing work in London, co-founded an Energy Efficiency company, taught english in Vietnam, and set up an online store selling guayusa after spending weeks in Ecuador sourcing it. </p>
            <p> When not writing code and putting my thoughts to proverbial paper, I can be found surfing and attempting to hit a golf ball around. </p>
            <p> Particularly interested in the potential of tech in solving social and environmental issues.</p>
