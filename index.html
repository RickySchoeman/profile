     <h1>Ricky Schoeman</h1>
      <p><strong> A curious mind and newfound code nerd, with an entrepreneurial spirit and very itchy feet!</strong></p>
     <p> After studying Ecomomics and Environmental Science in South Africa, I have spent the last decade on and off yachts sailing across oceans, teaching english in Asia, traveling on a very slim budget, and founding two businesses. And even thrown in a very short 'corporate gig' for good measure!</p>
     <p> Interested in the potential of tech in solving social and environmental issues, I recently started my coding journey and have fallen in love with it and the community!</p>

           <h2>A platform for the Conscious Consumer</h2>
            <p>My idea behind Amandla was that while most people would like to be better social and environmental consumers, there are so many different metrics to measure this by - which can be overwhelming. Amandla makes this easier, by allowing a user to filter the desired social and environmental causes they would like to support, and directs them to businesses that are aligned with these beliefs</p>
            <p>Amandla was built over 2 weeks using Ruby on Rails, HTML + CSS, and JavaScript. Mobile responsive</p>

        <h2>Airbnb for plants!</h2>
        <p>The idea was to create a clone of Airbnb (with all the functionality of Airbnb) in a week. This is what my team and I came up with!</p>
        <p>Built using Ruby on Rails, HTML + CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
